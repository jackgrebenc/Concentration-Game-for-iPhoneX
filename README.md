Game of concentration ideal for the iphoneX in portrait mode.

# What I learned 
-> Using Swift and the Xcode storyboard to create a functioning game  
-> Utilizing @IBOutlets/@IBActions to communicate between the view and the model (MVC Architecture)  
-> The use of structs, extensions and Swift optionals
